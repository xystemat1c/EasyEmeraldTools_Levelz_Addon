# xystemat1c's Levelz addon

Datapack to add mod compatibility to Levelz by *Globox_Z* [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/levelz).

## Currently planned mod support
- Easy Emerald Tools by *kwpugh* (Work in progress) -> [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-emerald-tools-fabric)
- Basic Shields by *CrimsonDawn45* (Work in progress) -> [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/basic-shields-fabric)
- *maybe more in future*

## How to use

1. Download this Datapack
2. Add it to your world by moving the .zip file to ...path_to_minecraft_folder_location/.minecraft/saves/WORLD_FOLDER/datapacks/
3. Enjoy!

For the best experience I recommend to do this at or directly after world creation.
